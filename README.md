# computer Russian roulette #
This is a simple learning project.
The project is an **analogy of Russian roulette**. :smiley:  
When you start the application, a number (0-7) is selected at random.   
**If 0 is dropped** , the selected file ("exampleFile1.md") **is deleted**. :dizzy_face:  
In a **successful case**, a **text file** (“sample.txt”) **is created** in the directory. It duplicates information (this information is also output directly to the console) about whether you are lucky or not! :wink:

# How its working #
`make` to compilate the app  
`make clean` to delete build  
`make kill` to run the app   

_The application changes files, so makefile chmoding the .sh files that the application is using_
